Template repository for iSci 3A12 assignment 1 - Climate Claims

## Instructions
Use this repository to create and submit your work for Assignment 1. **You will not be submitting via Avenue** -- instead, Madie and Jay have access to this repository and will **view it in place**. Refer to your assignment sheet (in Avenue) for more details. 

I have provided an example markdown file in this repository (called submission.md), which provides a basic template for you to use when creating your submission. 

## To do: 
- Create a new markdown file (your-title.md) in this repository
- Use the submission.md as a guide (you can even copy and paste markdown from this document to yours).
